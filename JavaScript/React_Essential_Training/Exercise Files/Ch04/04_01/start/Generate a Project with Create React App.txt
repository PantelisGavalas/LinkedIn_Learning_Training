 Step 1
--------
We need to have Node.js installed (from https://nodejs.org/en).
We check it in the terminal with:
"node -v"



 Step 2
--------
We check the version of npm on terminal with:
"npm -v"
Anything above 5.2 allows us to run Step 3.



 Step 3
--------
We go to our wanted directory with cd and run:
"npm create-react-app our-react-project-name"
This installs React, ReactDOM, React Scripts (Babel, compiling etc.) and sets up everything from scratch for us.



 EXTRA Step
------------
If Step 3 doesn't work we can run:
"npm uninstall -g create-react-app"
and then:
"npm install -g create-react-app"
to reinstall it globally.



 Step 4
--------
Once that's done we go inside our app:
"cd our-react-project-name"
and then do:
"npm start"
This pops up a localhost window which is the starting point for building our app that will run locally.
